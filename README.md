This repository contains instructions and information for using the Paytrace JSON API (code name: Hermes). A general directory structure follows:

/dot_net -- code samples and documentation for using the JSON API with the C#.NET language
/java -- code samples and documentation for using the JSON API with the Java language
/php -- code samples and documentation for using the JSON API with the PHP language


Note:

1. Most languages have many ways to achieve the same process. All that are needed to communicate with the JSON API are an OAuth 2 capable client library and an HTTP connection library.
2. OAuth 2 authentication can also be done "in the raw" without a library, by simply observing the basic rules of interaction with the OAuth system, and with the Paytrace API server. OAuth 2 client libraries simply make this process easier and more transparent to the developer.
